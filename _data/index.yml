        title: Accurate Layout Detection with a Simple and Clean Interface
        description: |
          With the help of state-of-the-art deep learning models, Layout Parser enables extracting complicated document structures using only several lines of code. 
          This method is also more robust and generalizable as no sophisticated rules are involved 
          in this process.

        description: |
          To accommodate heterogenous document layout structures, Layout Parser a collection of DL models trained on different datasets. Currently the are 9 models trained on 5 diverse datasets, and they can be loaded via a unified interface.

      - name: Layout Data structure
        title: Easy Layout Data Manipulation and Processing
        description: |
          Layout Parser supports different levels of abstraction of layout data, and provide three classes of representation for layout data, namely, `Coordinates`, `TextBlock`, and `Layout`. The same operations and transformations are supported inter and intra these classes to maximize the efficiency when processing the layout data.

      - name: Visualization
        title: Highly Customizable Layout Data Visualization 
        description: | 
          Layout Parser visualizes the layout data using a simple syntax: `lp.draw_box` or `lp.draw_text`. It provides two modes for displaying the layout data: Mode I directly overlays the layout region bounding boxes and categories over the original image. Mode II recreates the original document via drawing the OCR’d texts at their corresponding positions on the image canvas.

      - name: Export and Storage
        title: Export Layout Data in Your Favorite Format
        description: | 
          Layout Parser supports loading and exporting layout data to different formats, including general formats like `csv`, `json`, or domain-specific formats like `PAGE`, `COCO`, or `METS/ALTO` format (Full support for them will be released soon). It provides the flexibility for integrating Layout Parser with other document image analysis pipelines, and makes it easy to share your outputs with the community.

        title: Easy to Train Your Own Layout Models with Best Accuracy
        description: |
          Layout Parser also comes with full support for customized layout model training on your own dataset. This enables you to achieve optimal prediction accuracy on your own dataset and can simplify your pipeline. Different training mode are supported, i.e., training from scratch or fine-tuning from an existing model.

        title: Efficiently Creating Your Training Dataset
        description: |
          No labeled training data available? Don't worry! Layout Parser also incorporates a data annotation toolkit that enables creating the training dataset much more efficiently. 
          Shown in the illustration below, the tool loads layout predictions from pre-trained models (a), and users only need to select and check a small percentage of model predictions to correct or relabel (b). False-Negative Highlighter (c) helps recognize mis-identified objects from the model predictions. After these steps, the full image annotation is created with less effort.

      - name: Sharing Platform
        title: Layout Models & Pipelines Sharing Platform
        description: |
          Layout Parser also aims to create a community platform for document image analysis (DIA) research and application. One key challenge in current DIA is the reusability of both layout models and pipelines. Layout Parser maintainers are currently working on implementing the platform for practitioners to share their models and pipelines easily. By streamline the distribution of layout models, as well as promoting the reusability of layout pipelines, it can potentially transform the DIA workflow and pipelines broadly.
